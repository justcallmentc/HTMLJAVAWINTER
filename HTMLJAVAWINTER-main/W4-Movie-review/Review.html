        <p>In the movie <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i> by Scott Cawthon we follow mike as he gets new a job as a worker at freddy fazebears pizzaria, the movie starts out very slow and remains quite slow and uneventful for most of the movie. By the time the name sake freddy fazebear and the other animatronics actually do anything its the last 20 or so minutes of the movie and the rest is the spent on a weird hard to follow storyline about missing children. We do not see the main "antagonist" of the series william afton until the very end of the movie and he adds nothing to it besides having the animatronics actually do something. 1/100000</p>
